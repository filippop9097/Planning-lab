    "\n",
    "The Blocksworld planning domain is a well-known problem in automated planning. It involves a set of blocks and a table, where the task is to move the blocks from an initial arrangement to a desired goal configuration. Each block can be individually placed on the table or stacked on another block, with a limited set of actions available for picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks. The challenge lies in determining a sequence of moves that will transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration while respecting constraints such as block order and availability. Although simple in concept, Blocksworld highlights fundamental planning challenges like ordering dependencies, managing subgoal interactions, and efficiently exploring possible sequences of actions.\n",

    "### Types\n",
    "- **Blocks**: Each block has a unique identifier (e.g. A, B, C) and can be stacked on top of other blocks or placed on the table. The blocks are homogeneous in size, shape, and weight, so they can be freely moved or stacked.\n",
    "- **Table**: The table acts as a foundational surface where blocks can be placed individually when not stacked on other blocks. We will not explicitly model the table in the domain definition, since we will use a special predicate to represent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Representation (Fluents):\n",
    "- **On(Block1, Block2)**: A relation that denotes Block1 is on top of Block2.\n",
    "- **OnTable(Block)**: A relation indicating that a block is directly on the table, this predicate allows us to represent the interaction with the table.\n",
    "- **Clear(Block)**: A relation indicating that a block has nothing on top of it and can thus be moved.\n",
    "- **Holding(Block)**: Represents the agent holding a specific block. The agent can only hold one block at a time.\n",
    "- **HandEmpty**: A state indicating that the agent is not holding anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Below you can see how this definition can be represented in PDDL:**"
